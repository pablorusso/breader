    <title>1- Pavement: Wowee Zowee: Sordid Sentinels Edition: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39532-wowee-zowee-sordid-sentinels-edition
</link>
    <description>
         
Stephen Malkmus writes in the liner notes of the expanded 2xCD
reissue of  Wowee Zowee  that many of his friends like this Pavement record
best. In 2006, that&amp;#39;s not a crazy notion:  Wowee Zowee  was Pavement&amp;#39;s  White
Album , a little bit of everything thrown together, and as with the Beatles&amp;#39;
double, its adherents prefer the band at its loosest, funniest, and most willing to
do whatever pops into their heads. 
 
 
But I wonder what S.M.&amp;#39;s friends thought when  WZ  was
released in April 1995. Press reviews at the time were mixed, and a lot of
Pavement fans were disappointed. After the faintly commercial move of  Crooked
Rain, Crooked Rain , with its alt-rock hit single and coherent set of
fully realized songs,  Wowee Zowee  seemed a retreat, a record that took
the slacker ethos to heart and didn&amp;#39;t bother much with songwriting. It
possessed none of the key virtues of their first two full-lengths.  Slanted
and Enchanted , like the singles that preceded it, was unfocused but filled
with mystery, a cloudy shape outlining a great band in the process of becoming.
And  CR, CR  was clear and direct, bursting with melody, the sound of vast
potential and supreme confidence fully realized. But  Wowee Zowee  was
scattered, jokey, maybe even trivial; the band had tipped its hand and some
were seeing a bluff. 
 
 
But further listens and
passing time improved the sound of  Wowee Zowee . The original A,
stretching from &amp;quot;We Dance&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Serpentine Pad&amp;quot;, may be the
best album side they ever managed. And the strangely effective construction of
Malkmus&amp;#39; songs bring to mind a question that wasn&amp;#39;t asked the first time around:
What if he wasn&amp;#39;t screwing around, but instead was bored with where he&amp;#39;d been
and looking for a new songwriting language? He found one, at any rate, and it
all centered on his guitar. Malkmus never played better than he did here,
though he didn&amp;#39;t solo much. Instead, he let the guitar serve as the duet
partner that Spiral Stairs never was, using breathtakingly melodic lines to
serve as a chorus of sorts on &amp;quot;Black Out&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Grounded&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Pueblo&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Flux=Rad&amp;quot;; all have a guitar part at their
center in a place where another songwriter might have put a vocal hook.
 
 
The best songs on  Wowee Zowee  are slower and
more meandering than what came before, and only give a passing glance to things
like chorus, bridge, or meaning. As far as the latter, Malkmus was obviously
picking words mostly by how they sounded, which by and large worked out great.
An occasional line pops out and you&amp;#39;re not sure if it&amp;#39;s great or terrible--
&amp;quot;Pick out some Brazilian nuts for your engagement/ Check the expiration
date, man, it&amp;#39;s later than you think&amp;quot; from &amp;quot;We Dance&amp;quot; springs to
mind, sung in a faux-Brit accent reminiscent of the Frogs-- but you wind up
remembering those phrases, and the melodies in which they&amp;#39;re wedged. 
 
 
There are a few throwaways-- don&amp;#39;t have much
use for &amp;quot;Extradition&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fight this Generation&amp;quot;, and
&amp;quot;Western Homes&amp;quot;-- but such goofs were part and parcel with Pavement,
at least up to this point. Their final two records would contain only
fleshed-out songs and are accordingly less favored by fans.  Wowee Zowee 
was also the first and only time Spiral Stairs had a song (&amp;quot;Kennel
District&amp;quot;) that, though much more conventional, was every bit as good as
anything Malkmus managed. 
 
 
As with the reissues of their first two records, this
edition of  Wowee Zowee  comes with non-album B-sides rounding out the first
disc, and a second CD of outtakes, radio shots, live songs, and
compilation tracks. With the main album including an additional half-dozen
songs compared to its predecessors, the quality of the B-sides is suspect compared to previous Pavement reissues-- though &amp;quot;Kriss Kraft&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Mussle Rock (Is a Horse in
Transition)&amp;quot; (the second best song Spiral Stairs ever wrote) are easily
good enough to fit on the album proper, and the entire  Pacific Trim  EP
borders on great. 
 
 
Disc 2 is a tougher slog. Some of the
compilation tracks are good-- &amp;quot;Sensitive Euro Man&amp;quot; from the  I Shot
Andy Warhol  soundtrack has an easy tunefulness, and &amp;quot;No More
Kings&amp;quot; from the  Schoolhouse Rock! Rocks  compilation reveals
Pavement as the primo interpreters of Generation X arcana, making the
educational cartoon song sound like something the band wrote, thick with a
playful sense of nostalgia. But I can&amp;#39;t imagine why anyone would prefer
alternative versions of songs like &amp;quot;Kris Kraft&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I Love
Perth&amp;quot; (both live in BBC studios), &amp;quot;Heaven Is a Truck&amp;quot;, or
&amp;quot;Best Friend&amp;#39;s Arm&amp;quot; (live in Australia). But these misses are
keeping, I suppose, with the spirit of Matador&amp;#39;s ambitious reissue project, so
we have to take the bad with the good. And when you&amp;#39;re talking Pavement in 1995
and 1996, there&amp;#39;s no question, you&amp;#39;re talking very, very good.

    <title>2- Vince Guaraldi: A Charlie Brown Christmas: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39959-a-charlie-brown-christmas
</link>
    <description>
         
Taken like a spoonful of Nyquil just before you pass out from flu
exhaustion, nostalgia is no harm at all. In fact, it&amp;#39;s positively uplifting,
even if that lift up hampers your hipness standing to the point where you might
as well be culturally asleep. Short trips to what was probably an imaginary
past-- immaculate family gatherings around the tree, perfect junior high
summers with perfect junior high kisses-- aren&amp;#39;t necessarily grounds for an
inner guilt trip. But depending on your references, be prepared to defend your
sleepy tastes to anyone who doesn&amp;#39;t care for fuzzy focus warmth or the notion
that fond reminisce amounts to anything more than premature senility. Enter  Peanuts .
 
 
Best Buy racks full of oldie television DVDs and forgotten cartoons might
otherwise testify to a healthy market for nostalgia, but Charles Schultz&amp;#39;s
mini-verse-- kids, a dog, unrequited love, and the complete and utter failure
of the adult world to play a part in any of it-- suggests that the glowing past
wasn&amp;#39;t as warm as we remember. This was the genius of the strip: exposing small
epiphanies and defeats as the content of real life, even if the lives involved
were cartoons, and most (but not all) of the readers were too young to care
about the accuracy of Schulz&amp;#39;s observations. Now enter San Francisco pianist Vince Guaraldi. 
 
 
Playing a smooth brand of West Coast jazz comparable to Dave Brubeck or a  very 
snappy Bill Evans, and having scored a modest pop hit with &amp;quot;Cast Your Fate
to the Wind&amp;quot;, Guaraldi made an easy choice in 1963 for television producer
Lee Mendelson as composer for a documentary on Schulz and  Peanuts . The
doc was made, but never aired; apparently, the networks didn&amp;#39;t want kids
hearing any unnecessary &amp;quot;adult&amp;quot; thoughts about  Peanuts . So
when plans for  A Charlie Brown Christmas  came to fruition in 1965,
Guaraldi&amp;#39;s music-- including the classic &amp;quot;Linus and Lucy&amp;quot; theme-- got
its chance. The rest is history: the special has been rebroadcast every year
since its premier and, though Guaraldi&amp;#39;s death of a heart attack in 1976 (in
between sets at a club no less) prevented him from seeing the full extent of
his influence on popular culture, it would be hard to name a more recognizable
cartoon theme, give or take a Danny Elfman piece. 
 
 
But then the reissue of Guaraldi&amp;#39;s soundtrack for  A Charlie Brown
Christmas  has a lot more going for it than &amp;quot;Linus and Lucy&amp;quot;.
Melancholy covers of &amp;quot;O Tannenbaum&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;What Child Is This?&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;The Christmas Song&amp;quot;, and &amp;quot;Hark, the Herald Angels Sing&amp;quot;--
and yes, it has the  Peanuts  kids singing &amp;quot;loo-loo-loo,
l-loo-loo-loo-loo&amp;quot;-- make for the perfect dysfunctional holiday music.
Certainly, I will make a point this year to get too drunk, thereby spending the
week after Christmas listening to this record and regretting telling off my
grandma. However, it doesn&amp;#39;t have to be so bad; Guaraldi&amp;#39;s rolling, snow-mystic
touches on &amp;quot;What Child Is This?&amp;quot; or his reconstruction of &amp;quot;Little
Drummer Boy&amp;quot; as the minimalist bossa &amp;quot;My Little Drum&amp;quot; are
hypnotic, faithful mappings of the rhythm of snow falling, or the reflections
of people walking by store windows. 
 
 
And &amp;quot;Linus and Lucy&amp;quot; is here in all its deceptively simple glory.
In fact, the motive bass line and a perfect realization of the melody are
patterns that should be taught to all beginning piano students as models of
efficient finger technique. The closest parallel to this music is Philip
Glass, and really, &amp;quot;Linus and Lucy&amp;quot; is a lot more interesting than
anything Glass has done in years. Guaraldi&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;Christmas Is Coming&amp;quot; is
similarly kinetic, shining with the kind of understated elation you&amp;#39;d expect
for any music soundtracking the misadventures of kids always ready to celebrate
while perpetually shown the downside of Christmas. If there&amp;#39;s a muted quality
to a lot of this music, it&amp;#39;s smiling nonetheless. 
 
 
The reissue includes alternate takes of several tracks, and great liner
notes detailing the history of the project. Even the cover is cool, with an
animation still and foldout, faux LP-style jacket. If all of this screams
&amp;quot;stocking stuffer,&amp;quot; please don&amp;#39;t let me stop you. Nostalgic though it
may be, anything that&amp;#39;s as full of introspection, empathy, disappointment,
loneliness, and the perpetual hope of better things around the corner can&amp;#39;t be
all bad. Like the strip, Guaraldi&amp;#39;s songs here are small, observant miracles.

    <title>3- Junior Boys: So This Is Goodbye: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/37796-so-this-is-goodbye
</link>
    <description>
        My first introduction to Junior Boys was in autumn 2003. I had taken half a year off to travel alone, and I&amp;#39;d just left London, where a friend had given me a copy of the  Birthday  EP. I&amp;#39;d heard the single once or twice in passing before, but my first meaningful interaction with it wasn&amp;#39;t until later that week, on a nine-hour night train ride from Austria to Budapest. I listened to the whole EP on repeat that night, its brittle rhythms and gleaming synths coalescing with the dark shapes and city lights in constant renewal on the other side of my window, the unfamiliarity of my surroundings giving it all a further resonance. 
 
There are special songs, and there are special memories, but if you&amp;#39;re one of those nostalgia-bitten people for whom neither seem quite vivid enough on their own, nothing matches what happens when the two dovetail. The beauty of these moments is they refuse to be architected-- we can&amp;#39;t force them any more than we can explain them. And while the Junior Boys aren&amp;#39;t magicians, they speak the language of that magic as well as anyone making music today. (In the band&amp;#39;s official bio, K-Punk blog&amp;#39;s Mark Fisher writes that  So This Is Goodbye  is a &amp;quot;travel sick&amp;quot; record-- I&amp;#39;d go him one further and say that specific sensation of travel sickness is at stake every time they set out to make music.) 
 
 
Just their second full-length overall,  So This Is Goodbye  isn&amp;#39;t just an improbable notch above 2004&amp;#39;s  Last Exit -- it&amp;#39;s also among the best records you&amp;#39;ll hear all year. The first complete album made by vocalist Jeremy Greenspan without the aid of founding member and presumed rhythmic engine Johnny Dark, it finds the Boys (now rounded out by onetime engineer Matthew Didemus) working within comparatively streamlined song structures, the rhythmic capriciousness that so strongly informed their debut all but erased from the whiteboard. And yet, despite this radical formal departure,  Goodbye  draws out so many of the same sensations and colors that it feels like a natural next step. If anything, the absence of those slippery rhythm tracks puts the focus even more squarely on Greenspan, who delivers with a record full of elegant melodies. 
 
 
Beyond the glowing synthlines, frigid percussions, and Greenspan&amp;#39;s marvellously tensile voice (imagine Ben Gibbard with much higher cheekbones), the Junior Boys&amp;#39; greatest weapon is space. With an economical 10 tracks spread out over nearly 49 minutes, the pop in  So This Is Goodbye  is hardly immediate; instead, its songs are allowed to percolate and unfurl. On paper, especially to the average thrillseeker, that might sound a bit offputting, but it&amp;#39;s not like these are all ballads, either. Opener &amp;quot;Double Shadow&amp;quot; begins with a gentle pattering sequence of synth beads but blooms into a smartly melodic slice of electrohouse that Booka Shade would be proud to call their own. Elsewhere, with its serrated analog lead, gushy pads, skipping rhythms, and pressurized vocals, &amp;quot;The Equalizer&amp;quot; accounts for one of the album&amp;#39;s finest arrangements, while the uptempo first single &amp;quot;In The Morning&amp;quot; finds Greenspan merging icy r&amp;amp;b with 4AD&amp;#39;s warm guitar sounds to beautiful effect. 
 
 
In the end, though, the biggest goosebumps come courtesy of the slowburners. The penultimate track &amp;quot;When No One Cares&amp;quot; recasts the Sinatra standard as a wobbly space ballad, closer &amp;quot;FM&amp;quot; crosses the finish line in an unhurried cloud of staccato arpeggios and warm harmonies, and standout &amp;quot;Count Souvenirs&amp;quot; marries liquefied synths and keening minor-key melodies with the album&amp;#39;s starkest imagery (&amp;quot;Empty stalls and shopping malls that we&amp;#39;ll never see again/ Hotel lobbies like painful hobbies that linger on&amp;quot;). Finally, the album&amp;rsquo;s title track finds
Greenspan singing: &amp;quot;So
this is goodbye, no need to lie/ This creature of pain, has found me
again/ So
this is goodbye,&amp;quot; possibly in reference to Dark, or to his departed
former
label head Nick Kilroy, or to someone else entirely. It&amp;#39;s the album&amp;#39;s heartbeat, as well as one of its weightiest moments-- an acknowledgment that in times of despair the
best course
of action is often just to keep moving. Wanderlust
never
sounded so good.

    <title>4- The Decemberists: The Crane Wife: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/38886-the-crane-wife
</link>
    <description>
         
For a few years now, the Decemberists&amp;#39; stagey, hyperliterate folk-rock has played well at indie labels Hush and Kill Rock Stars.
The quintet has occupied a small community-theater space with gleefulness
and confidence, but now it&amp;#39;s accepted a scholarship to Capitol Records,
which means a larger stage and a bigger audience. Can the band still project, or
will its voices be lost in a cavernous auditorium, rejoined only by
crickets and barely stifled coughs of boredom? Will nine-minute mariner
epics play in Peoria?
 
 
Given the band&amp;#39;s graduation from minor to major leagues,  The Crane Wife  may prove to be the most
crucial record the Decemberists will release in their lifetime.
Fortunately, their fourth album further magnifies and refines their strengths.
Winsomely balancing frivolity and gravity, the Decemberists assemble an oddball
menagerie of the usual rogues and rascals, soldiers and criminals, lovers and
baby butchers-- but they&amp;#39;ve got a lot more tricks up their sleeves than previous
albums had hinted.  The Crane Wife  employs
an impressive variety of styles and sounds to tell Meloy&amp;#39;s imaginative stories: There&amp;#39;s the band&amp;#39;s usual folk-rock, honed to an incisively sharp point, but
they also deploy a smuggler&amp;#39;s blues (&amp;quot;The Perfect Crime&amp;quot;), a creepy lullaby
(&amp;quot;Shankill Butchers&amp;quot;), a Led Zep stomp (&amp;quot;When the War Came&amp;quot;), and, perhaps most
divisively, a multipart prog track (&amp;quot;The Island&amp;quot;) that stretches well past the 10-minute mark. No epic chantey this time, though.
 
 
Meloy&amp;#39;s inventive
songwriting is the binding force, emphasizing character but remaining ever in thrall to stories,
savoring the way they always play out to the same conclusions. Along with the
homosexual undertones that have informed Decemberists songs from every album,
he jettisons most of the archetypes that inspired  Picaresque  and cuts his characters loose in their own tales. They
still do what they&amp;#39;re fated to do-- the thieves thieve and run amok, the lovers
love and die tragically, the soldiers soldier on and pine for peaceful homes-- but
they seem to do it more out of free will than authorial design. 
 
 
Meloy focuses mainly
on matters of war (&amp;quot;But O did you see all the dead of Manassas/ All the bellies and the bones and the bile?&amp;quot;) and love (&amp;quot;No, I lingered here
with the blankets barren/ And my own belly big with child&amp;quot;). On the duet
&amp;quot;Yankee Bayonet (I Will Be Home Then)&amp;quot;, Meloy plays the part of an errant, possibly
dead Civil War soldier while singer-songwriter Laura Veirs cameos as his
&amp;quot;sweetheart left behind.&amp;quot; It&amp;#39;s  Cold     Mountain 
writ poignantly small, its sweet, wordless chorus perfectly life-size. Lumbering
menacingly, the martial march of &amp;quot;When the War Came&amp;quot; smells of gunpowder and
singed hair, although it sounds like it&amp;#39;s anchored in Neverland despite trying
to comment on real-world events. 
 
 
Meloy&amp;#39;s taletelling will always define the Decemberists, but
 The Crane Wife  puts as much weight on
the music as on the lyrics, and here the band gels
into a tight, intuitive unit. The musicians give each song a particular spark and character, not
just reinforcing the lyrics but actively telling a story. They create a breezy
eddy of guitar strums and piano chords to enhance a windborne melody and an
undercurrent of peril on &amp;quot;Summersong&amp;quot;, and the tragedy of &amp;quot;O Valencia&amp;quot;-- any
good song about star-crossed lovers must end in death-- is countered by the pep
of the music, especially Chris Funk&amp;#39;s ascending and descending guitar, which
seems to take a particular glee in the inevitable denouement. The band isn&amp;#39;t
just able-bodied, but ambitious to boot. It makes the brainy prog of that
monster second track, a distillation of the musical reach of their 2003 EP  The Tain , sound like a natural extension
of their base sound. They troll confidently from the rumbling overture and
heated exposition of &amp;quot;Come and See&amp;quot; to the final rueful notes of &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll Not
Feel the Drowning&amp;quot;. The song is chockablock with progisms-- organ runs,
dampered cymbals, laser synths-- but manages to shake off the genre quote marks
as the band jam with convincing menace.
 
 
Their range allows them to be precociously diverse, but
everything fits naturally.  The
Crane Wife  sounds like their most shapely album to date, resembling a
spirited story arc in its set-up, rising action, climax, and resolution. In
this structure the three title segments, despite essentially bookending the
tracklist, form the album&amp;#39;s thematic centerpiece, the music and story meshing
gracefully and tenderly to retell a Japanese fable. &amp;quot;The Crane Wife 3&amp;quot; opens
the album with a ruminative flourish as John Moen&amp;#39;s drums push the sensuous
thrust of the music and Meloy&amp;#39;s delivery of the lines &amp;quot;each feather it fell
from skin&amp;quot; colors the resignation of &amp;quot;I will hang my head hang my head low.&amp;quot; It
opens the album  en medias res ,
setting up the subsequent story-songs as the narrator&amp;#39;s rueful reminiscences.
 
 
&amp;quot;The
Crane Wife 1 and 2&amp;quot; comprise a medley towards the album&amp;#39;s end, starting slow
and soft but gradually reaching crescendo in an unfurling finale, with Meloy
breaking the word &amp;quot;heart&amp;quot; into multiple syllables over an unraveling drum beat.
Restrained
yet resonant, the song&amp;#39;s (and album&amp;#39;s) climax is a remarkable moment. As it
segues into the rousing coda of &amp;quot;Sons &amp;amp; Daughters&amp;quot;, the Decemberists sound
like a band that knows exactly where they&amp;#39;re going and won&amp;#39;t be satisfied until
you come along for the trip.

    <title>5- Oasis: Stop the Clocks: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39916-stop-the-clocks
</link>
    <description>
         
While reading a recent  Blender  article on the Killers, I was
suddenly hit with a wave of bittersweet nostalgia. In the piece, Brandon Flowers
espouses his rock star ideals. &amp;quot;You want to see a god onstage,&amp;quot; said the singer. &amp;quot;You
want to see something larger than life and unattainable. I was like, &amp;#39;I could
do that.&amp;#39;&amp;quot; Thing is, he can&amp;#39;t   do that.  At all . But Oasis most certainly
could and did in their mid-90s heyday. And most of this contract-fulfilling
2xCD best-of reinforces the Manchester-bred group&amp;#39;s best qualities:
brashness, swagger, and melodies for miles. 
 
 
The compilation also upholds the sad-but-true notion that the
Gallaghers &amp;amp; Co. haven&amp;#39;t come up with a great tune
in nearly a decade. In their wake have been plenty of pretenders repolishing
classic rock gems for a new century (Jet, Wolfmother, Kings of Leon), but none
can match Noel&amp;#39;s keen ear or Liam&amp;#39;s indelible bleat. And whereas Flowers&amp;#39;
arrogance is empty and halfhearted, Oasis&amp;#39;s bravado sounded like
gospel to this suburban teen reading imported Brit mags on a Barnes &amp;amp; Noble
bench. And, most important, they had a plethora of era-defining songs to back up much of their hot air. 
 
 
 Stop the Clocks  largely proves what fans already
know: Oasis were at their best when they were coming up from the bottom. Their 1994-95 ascendancy fittingly provides the retrospective
with nearly 80% of its material. Both  Definitely Maybe  and  (What&amp;#39;s the
Story) Morning Glory?  are represented with five tracks a piece, while four B-sides from the era also appear. Though classics like &amp;quot;Rock &amp;#39;N&amp;#39; Roll
Star&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Cigarettes &amp;amp; Alcohol&amp;quot; have come to represent
clich&amp;eacute;d ideas of stardom and its vices, those songs were originally written
from the outside looking in. Liam is given triumphant lines
based on figments rather than reality: &amp;quot;In my mind my dreams are
real,&amp;quot; he snarls, willing his hopes toward actuality over the band&amp;#39;s spiky Led Zeppelin crunch. 
 
 
Fearless optimism reins on the group&amp;#39;s best-ever track,
&amp;quot;Live Forever&amp;quot;, a quasi-reaction to the nihilism of grunge. Talking
about the song in an excellent &amp;quot;this is your life&amp;quot;-style 40-minute
interview included on  Stop the Clocks &amp;#39; deluxe edition DVD,
Noel dismisses some of Kurt Cobain&amp;#39;s heroin-laced diatribes  while backing up the careful hope of his signature track: &amp;quot;That was a guy that had everything and was
miserable.
We had
fuck all and I still thought getting up in the morning was the greatest
fuckin&amp;#39; thing ever &amp;#39;cause you didn&amp;#39;t know where you&amp;#39;d end up at night.&amp;quot;
Such escapism and idealist wonder found blissful haven inside Oasis&amp;#39;s finest tracks.
&amp;quot;I dream of you-- and all the things you say/ I wonder where you are
now?&amp;quot; sings Liam on the blustery distortion ballad &amp;quot;Slide Away&amp;quot;,
once again reiterating the band&amp;#39;s romanticism. 
 
 
Aside from the inclusion of obviously lesser post-1996
tracks-- which stick out clumsily amidst the undisputed greats-- and the minor
squabbles that are sure to arise over which B-sides Noel left out, the collection&amp;#39;s most controversial point has to be the
exclusion of anything from the group&amp;#39;s coke-fueled third album,  Be Here Now . While
that infamously excessive LP was a clear step down from previous heights, it&amp;#39;s also more ambitious and tuneful than any album they&amp;#39;ve
released since. Tracks like the crushing, murky epic &amp;quot;D&amp;#39;You Know What I
Mean&amp;quot;, swelling heartbreaker &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Go Away&amp;quot; or underrated burner &amp;quot;I Hope, I Think, I Know&amp;quot; blow away  Stop the Clocks 
skippables like &amp;quot;Lyla&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;Go Let It Out&amp;quot;. (And to Noel&amp;#39;s credit, there are no new songs included as shameless sales-boosters.) 
 
In the DVD interview, Noel recounts how Creation
Records founder Alan McGee didn&amp;#39;t want to put &amp;quot;The Masterplan&amp;quot; out as
a B-side in 1995 because it was &amp;quot;too good.&amp;quot; &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t write shit
songs,&amp;quot; Noel remembers saying, before he checks himself: &amp;quot;Fast
forward about three years, and I&amp;#39;m fucking, &amp;#39;Can we put &amp;#39;Masterplan&amp;#39; out as a
single?&amp;#39;.&amp;quot; After their initial astonishing run of hits, Oasis reached their bacchanalian rock nirvana and had no idea what to do next. Instead of exploring new sounds and styles like their
Fab Four heroes once did, the group fell into a repetitive AC/DC rut by trying
to recreate past glories without the striving drive that originally gave them
life. Oasis only made two essential albums, so while its song selection is generally
wise, this double-disc rewind is totally unnecessary for both casual fans
and die-hards alike. But, for a fading, much loved band, it&amp;#39;s also a necessary evil. At least Liam has a sense of
humor about it-- in the accompanying video chat, he jokes, &amp;quot;Hopefully
we&amp;#39;ll be able to do another one and really fucking milk it.&amp;quot;

    <title>6- Deerhoof: Friend Opportunity: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40615-friend-opportunity
</link>
    <description>
        There&amp;#39;s a high you get from the classic 1970s &amp;quot;art-rock&amp;quot; of Yes, Genesis, or King Crimson-- and when it hits, there&amp;#39;s nothing like it. I&amp;#39;m not talking about the way other music peaks, like a dance track where the beat kicks in and the crowd goes berzerk, or metal music that gets louder and louder until your skull caves, or gutbucket singers who can make your heart jump out of your chest. With art-rock, there&amp;#39;s a lot of mumbo-jumbo and funny time signatures, and sometimes there&amp;#39;s like 10 or 15 minutes of really boring shit (see: Yes, &amp;quot;Awaken&amp;quot;). But when the &amp;quot;good part&amp;quot; hits? Holy shit-- the band crescendos and the singer, smooth as silk but loud as God, rams Buddha down the throat of a giant silver dragon. If I sound like I&amp;#39;m growing a mullet, I&amp;#39;ve done my job. 
 
Deerhoof, an indie band who have released plenty of discombobulated pop and no wave albums, have lately turned toward accessible, foot-stomping rock. It worked on  The Runners Four , but it works better and quicker on their new album,  Friend Opportunity . We&amp;#39;ve been using the term &amp;quot;inde prog&amp;quot; mostly to describe bands that quick-cut between ideas and construct mini-suites out of mini-songs. But on this record Deerhoof take everything that clique of indie bands has worked toward-- add the suddenly popular twee vocals-- and ride it like an h-bomb.
 
 
If it weren&amp;#39;t for Satomi Matsuzaki&amp;#39;s little-girl voice, this music would be demagoguery: concussive beats, stabbing horn fills, pounding drums, a guitar chord that lands like a 10-ton weight on a 20-ton trampoline. I&amp;#39;ve never been more aware of the attack of an electric piano. And while a new love of knob-twiddling and loop-peddling brings more tonal colors, they&amp;#39;re here for percussion, not atmosphere. 
 
 
I didn&amp;#39;t even want to make out all the words, in case I&amp;#39;d screw up the Obi Wan-spanks-Zelda Hero&amp;#39;s Journey I had in my head in tracks one through nine. Snatches of story-like lyrics-- the stage-setting of &amp;quot;The Perfect Me&amp;quot;, the flashes of conflict, warnings that &amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s a trap&amp;quot;-- imply a narrative arc, with a detour for a new character on &amp;quot;Cast Off Crown&amp;quot;, drummer Greg Saunier&amp;#39;s sole vocal performance and a mini-epic that crams introduction, exposition, and resolution into three minutes. 
 
 
The rest of the vocals are held down again by the high, heavily-accented singing of Matsuzaki. And the more song-like Deerhoof&amp;#39;s music gets, the more obviously she becomes a barrier to new fans. The bleep-bloop speak-singing of &amp;quot;Kidz are So Small&amp;quot; seems to be the dealbreaker-- like you shouldn&amp;#39;t take anything so sweet and cute seriously. (Listen to that gristly bleep in the background: that&amp;#39;s a fucking droid, dude.) But wait &amp;#39;til you hear the climactic &amp;quot;Matchbook Seeks Maniac&amp;quot;: Jesus, Matsuzaki is the homecoming queen from Saturn, complete with silver glitter makeup and hip-side death ray. She rides the album&amp;#39;s peak in the main chorus-- &amp;quot;I would sell my soul to the devil/ If I could be the top of the world&amp;quot;-- and when she belts the title phrase? It makes me  quail . 
 
 
Only thing is, after that 24-minute binge we get the 12-minute hangover of &amp;quot;Look Away&amp;quot;. Like a rambling, shapeless homage to Yes&amp;#39; &amp;quot;Sound Chaser&amp;quot;, it&amp;#39;s listenable and it has a great instrumental traffic jam at the midpoint, but on this record it&amp;#39;s just an appendix. All of a sudden the band is back to silences and blank stares, sustained tones and reverbed guitars. They&amp;#39;re &amp;quot;deconstructing pop,&amp;quot; which means they&amp;#39;re asking questions. But on  Friend Opportunity , Deerhoof work best when they blast right to the answers.

    <title>7- The Shins: Wincing the Night Away: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40605-wincing-the-night-away
</link>
    <description>
        While indie rock has embraced
grander and
more elaborate productions, the Shins have remained unlikely champions
of
uncertainty and understatement.   Unlike
many of their meteorically successful indie peers, the Shins don&amp;#39;t  want  to change your life-- and that&amp;#39;s a good thing, because the band&amp;#39;s biggest strength is an uncanny gift for conjuring a deep, vivid, and palpable sense of the familiar. Many of the Shins&amp;#39; best songs evoke a feeling of comfort
and
closeness that&amp;#39;s immediately recognizable but rarely experienced-- intimacy is the band&amp;#39;s best weapon, amplifying the subtle ebbs and flows of their music so
that the
slightest injection of unease or melancholy hits with remarkable force. 
 
On their third Sub Pop full-length,  Wincing the Night Away , the Shins take a decisive but wobbly step out of their comfort zone, and in doing so sacrifice much of this musical/emotional proximity effect. While the band has taken a good deal of criticism for sounding &amp;quot;too average&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;boring,&amp;quot; the ill-suited sonic punch of  Wincing the Night Away  throws the singular strengths of their previous work into stark relief. The almost-live sounding  Chutes Too Narrow  left plenty of room for singer James Mercer&amp;#39;s excellent vocals to guide its songs both melodically and rhythmically. But on  Wincing , too-loud drums and bass distract not only from the elegant movement of Mercer&amp;#39;s melodies, but from the delicate harmonic tensions that underlie them. 
 
That said, the first four tracks of  Wincing  are unerringly solid. Echoing the striking contrast of  Chutes Too Narrow  opener &amp;quot;Kissing the Lipless&amp;quot;,  Wincing &amp;#39;s lead track, &amp;quot;Sleeping Lessons&amp;quot;, builds from sparse, muffled arpeggios to full-on rock&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;roll. While slick and robust production doesn&amp;#39;t flatter much of the record, it works well as a counterpoint to the song&amp;#39;s quiet initial moments. &amp;quot;Australia&amp;quot; is a peppy rocker in the spirit of  Chutes &amp;#39; best, elevated by a newfound confidence and expressive range in Mercer&amp;#39;s voice. Single &amp;quot;Phantom Limb&amp;quot; is pure, lush pop, boasting a chorus that plays like the aural equivalent of that optical illusion where a staircase appears to ascend indefinitely. 
 
With the exception of the excellent &amp;quot;Red Rabbits&amp;quot;, the more noticeable aesthetic departures on  Wincing  don&amp;#39;t fare as well. &amp;quot;Sea Legs&amp;quot;, with its intrusive synthesized drum beat and lackluster arrangement, brings to mind that unfortunate Eve 6 song about putting your heart in a blender, while &amp;quot;Spilt Needles&amp;quot; comes off as sterile and overcalculated, despite its strong chorus. Still, the album finishes strong: &amp;quot;Girl Sailor&amp;quot; surpasses &amp;quot;Phantom Limb&amp;quot; in lyrics and overall structure, making it a likely contender for the album&amp;#39;s second single, and &amp;quot;A Comet Appears&amp;quot; is beautifully orchestrated, if
not terribly memorable, making it an appropriate closer for a record
that often
emphasizes texture over form. 
 
There&amp;#39;s a time-honored imperative to encourage bands for attempting to develop and expand, and the Shins could certainly take their music in many different directions with great success. But it&amp;#39;s hard not to notice that the least adventurous tracks on  Wincing the Night Away  are generally the most rewarding. In many cases, the album&amp;#39;s more experimental touches seem at odds with the natural elegance of Mercer&amp;#39;s songwriting, making it hard to read the album as a shoddy blueprint of what a more &amp;quot;difficult&amp;quot; Shins record might sound like. Instead,  Wincing the Night Away  is a lovely and well-executed album and-- for the first time in the band&amp;#39;s career-- nothing more.

    <title>8- Clap Your Hands Say Yeah: Some Loud Thunder: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40757-some-loud-thunder
</link>
    <description>
        Unless you&amp;#39;ve been living under a rock that is itself under a larger
rock-- or you&amp;#39;re not an indie rock fan-- the Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
story should have a folkloric familiarity to you. To read an indie blog
or webzine in 2005 was to hear the tale of five brave lads from Philly
and Brooklyn who bypassed the Byzantine conduits of record labels and
PR agencies, selling more than six figures&amp;#39; worth of their debut album
on the merits of the music alone. 
 
But online opinion is like a magnifying glass in sunlight: Whatever it admires too closely for too long is
enlarged, then incinerated. There was truth in the emerging narrative,
but it reflected longing more than reality; the band&amp;#39;s story became the
stuff of myth, and myths beg to be debunked. That
crystallization was completed when mainstream publications began
filling their pages with identical articles about the internet as
independent music&amp;#39;s democratic new frontier and adopting CYHSY as the
trend&amp;#39;s avatar. 
 
 
This was how, in the space of a couple months, CYHSY were transformed
from a unique phenomenon to a creative ideal, and the music contained
on their still-terrific debut album became difficult to hear above the
din of warring ideologues. &amp;quot;Two years ago,&amp;quot; the  Independent Online &amp;#39;s
Andrew Purcell wrote in a January 12 article, &amp;quot;Clap Your Hands Say Yeah
rewrote the rules of pop music, but this won&amp;#39;t save them from the
kicking that&amp;#39;s coming their way.&amp;quot; He&amp;#39;s probably right, but this isn&amp;#39;t
necessary if we&amp;#39;re careful not to get our distaste for packaged
mythology mixed up with distaste for the music itself. Before CYHSY&amp;#39;s
sophomore album  Some Loud Thunder  materialized, the question of
how the band would follow its hot-topic debut seemed hopelessly
complex. But given that the group had little to do with its own hype--
and that Alec Ounsworth is by all credible reports a very private
person who disdains public opinion-- the answer, in retrospect, is
obvious: They made another Clap Your Hands Say Yeah record.
 
 
If  Some Loud Thunder  isn&amp;#39;t as consistent as the debut, it&amp;#39;s
an adequate follow-up that contains a handful of fantastic songs, a
handful of uneven ones, and a handful of duds. Famed producer Dave
Fridmann (Flaming Lips, Mercury Rev, Mogwai) brings his usual touch to
the album-- it&amp;#39;s denser than the debut, with even more towering
harmonies. The only time Fridmann does the band a disservice is on the
title track, which opens the record with the same sort of vague
antagonism with which &amp;quot;Clap Your Hands!&amp;quot; kicked off the debut. &amp;quot;Some
Loud Thunder&amp;quot; seems like a solid, peppy indie rock song, but it&amp;#39;s such
a mess that it&amp;#39;s hard to tell for sure-- pickled in ugly distortion, it
sounds like a bad rip. (Ounsworth claims the album is intended to be
heard on vinyl; perhaps it works better there.) As a mission statement
and a fuck-off, &amp;quot;Some Loud Thunder&amp;quot; is even more effective than &amp;quot;Clap
Your Hands!&amp;quot;: The latter was obviously intended to be daunting, while
the former is rich with ambiguity. Was it meant to sound shitty or did
it just turn out that way? Regardless, it&amp;#39;s a drag to listen to. 
 
 
The most engaging songs here zero in on what CYHSY do best: cracked, brassy vocals, shaggy rhythms, and luxuriant
melodies. The flickering luau-rock of &amp;quot;Mama, Won&amp;#39;t You Keep Them
Castles in the Air and Burning?&amp;quot; finds Ounsworth&amp;#39;s clarion voice at its
most affecting, eventually washing out in a tide of woozy harmonies.
&amp;quot;Love Song No. 7&amp;quot;, with its slithering vocal line and stark piano, is
distinct from the band&amp;#39;s usual fizzy shimmer; it&amp;#39;s darker and finer
than anything else on the record. &amp;quot;Underwater (You and Me)&amp;quot; profits
from its density, with tight coils of reverbed guitar spring-loading
the bouncy melody. These tracks find CYHSY tweaking their template with
more sumptuous, Fridmann-assisted layers, with excellent results. 
 
 
An entire album of songs this well-tuned would have trumped the debut, but  Some Loud Thunder 
bogs down in some uneven ideas. The transition from bright acoustic
jangle to crispy garage-psych on &amp;quot;Emily Jean Stock&amp;quot; is vitalizing, but
Ounsworth&amp;#39;s drooping affectations emphasize the hokier qualities of his
voice. The goofy yet fun &amp;quot;Satan Said Dance&amp;quot; is an indie-dance track
laced with twittering sci-fi keyboards; one wonders if the indie world
is comfortable enough with its relationship to dancing to enjoy a
song about Hell being a place where Satan makes you dance. I have a
soft spot for the admittedly overcooked &amp;quot;Yankee Go Home&amp;quot;, a
Destroyer-caliber piece of musical theater where Ounsworth gets to
inflect the hell out of lubricated words naturally suited to his
slippery voice, like &amp;quot;Honolulu.&amp;quot; Rounding out these problematic tracks
are stillborns like the meandering &amp;quot;Arm and Hammer&amp;quot; and the throwaway
gypsy instrumental &amp;quot;Upon Encountering the Crippled Elephant&amp;quot;. 
 
 
In the end, one wonders if the hype didn&amp;#39;t exert a subtle influence on
CYHSY after all. Consider that Ounsworth, who represents himself as
being neither comfortable nor interested in anything resembling a
spotlight, has answered that hype with a murkier, weirder album than
the one that spawned it, one that seems pulled in too many different
directions. Then consider how the title  Some Loud Thunder 
seems, deliberately or not, to refer to the very extra-musical
cacophony that Ounsworth claims to be unaffected by. A wheel&amp;#39;s stationary hub
might not care about its spin, but it still feels the pressure of all those whirling spokes.

    <title>9- Gwen Stefani: The Sweet Escape: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40049-the-sweet-escape
</link>
    <description>
         
Is there another mainstream pop star who
flits between lights-on likeability and pouty-lipped empty vesseldom
as dramatically or frequently as Gwen Stefani?
In the three years since abandoning the MTV rock ghetto she inhabited with No Doubt, and her subsequent self-reinvention as a certifiable pop celeb and fashionplate mogul, she&amp;#39;s been doing wind
sprints between these two incompatible personae. Nonetheless,
since going solo with 2004&amp;#39;s patchy but single-rich  Love.Angel.Music.Baby. , Stefani&amp;#39;s remained above the fray of the ongoing clusterfuck between commerce and art-- and she&amp;#39;s done it by brand-building
in both the abstract sense (via her quest for pop cultural memes) and in the more
traditional sense (with her clothing line L.A.M.B. scoring bonus
cross-promotional hits with every in-song mention). 
 
Of course, Stefani also deserves credit for her gutsy
musical choices. The spazzy, overcaffeinated electro of past
singles like &amp;quot;What You Waiting For?&amp;quot; and the sparse drumline squibbles of
&amp;quot;Hollaback Girl&amp;quot; suggest she&amp;#39;s not content to merely rack
up hits; she also wants her game to be the freshest around. That&amp;#39;s a desirable
instinct in a pop star, and despite her predilection for hijacking what feels
like every single empty space on  The Sweet Escape  to play her own hypegirl (&amp;quot;How sick is this?&amp;quot; she beams in the
intro to &amp;quot;Breakin&amp;#39; Up&amp;quot;, minutes before declaring &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Get It Twisted&amp;quot; &amp;quot;the
most craziest shit ever&amp;quot;), her single-minded interest in smuggling the weirdest
sounds onto TRL results in some of  The
Sweet Escape&amp;#39;s  finest moments. 
 
Case in point: Lead single &amp;quot;Wind It Up&amp;quot;, which wraps a
&amp;quot;Lonely Goatherd&amp;quot; yodel sample from Stefani&amp;#39;s beloved  The Sound of Music  around a wriggly Neptunes
beat. As mainstream singles go, it&amp;#39;s an absurd-sounding concoction that skates
perilously close to the edge of utter ridiculousness, but something about the sheer
nerviness of the idea ultimately sees it through. If I had to guess at a
single from this year that eventually ingratiated itself to the highest number of first-time haters, this
would probably be it, and in Stefani&amp;#39;s world, that&amp;#39;s like the Holy Grail. Unlike
most pop singers, Stefani aims to win you over with oddity. (There&amp;#39;s a reason  Alice in Wonderland  was her last album&amp;#39;s most recurrant theme.) 
 
It&amp;#39;s a high-risk, high-reward strategy, but most of  The Sweet Escape&amp;#39;s  other gonzo pop songs
yield some degree of payout. &amp;quot;Now That You Got It&amp;quot; surfs on a loping hip-hop beat
and a staccato piano sample while Stefani splits wailing time with a chorus of
alarms. The Neptunes-produced &amp;quot;Yummy&amp;quot; earns Best Song status by moving from a
skeletal rhythmic backbone and resounding &amp;quot;Milkshake&amp;quot;-pinching triangle hit
into a spiralling melody line that sounds like a Sherman Brothers outtake.  Also, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t Get It Twisted&amp;quot; sounds like
reggaeton-polka. 
 
Thing is, it takes real time to wring genius out of the
obscure and unseemly, and time is not a luxury that Stefani the entrepreneur affords
herself. As such, most of  The Sweet Escape&amp;#39;s  problems arise as a result of her schedule-dicated slog back
towards middle ground. With the exception of the spazzy, Akon-produced doo-wop
track &amp;quot;The Sweet Escape&amp;quot; and the Keane-penned &amp;quot;Early Winter&amp;quot;-- which proves that
Stefani still has the ability to elevate an otherwise ordinary rock song to another level--
everything else here has the vague whiff of tossed-off album fattener. The
unofficial sequel to &amp;quot;What You Waiting For?&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Orange County Girl&amp;quot; boasts
another self-writing lyric (&amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t know what I&amp;#39;m doing back in the studio/
Getting greedy cause he said he had another sick flow/ So I had to hollaback
cause I didn&amp;#39;t get enough/ Still feel the Wonderland, Alice and the tick
tock&amp;quot;) that, in a Charle Kaufman-aping stylee, mistakes meta for content.  Elsewhere, &amp;quot;4 in the Morning&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;U Started
It&amp;quot; exhume the ghosts of S Club and Debbie Gibson respectively, in turn
destroying the mallpop cred that Stefani accrued with  L.A.M.B. &amp;#39;s
impeccable &amp;quot;Cool&amp;quot;. 
 
By now you get the point. One step forward, three steps
sideways, one step back,  The Sweet Escape 
continues in Stefani&amp;#39;s proud tradition of being caught somewhere between the
vanguard and the insipid. Considering this is the same person who once rolled
out &amp;quot;Hollaback Girl&amp;quot; and the Harajuku girls in one fell swoop, it&amp;#39;s not the
least bit surprising, but the pockets of brilliance here are compelling enough to
warrant holding out hope that Stefani&amp;#39;s best as a boundary-pushing pop singer
still lies ahead.

    <title>10- Modest Mouse: We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank: Pitchfork Record Review</title>

</link>
    <description>
         
For all of the pandemonium over the indie rock gold-record mainstream-radio-play explosion, few of the bands who breached Clear Channel&amp;#39;s glass ceiling were actually longtime members of the small-label fraternity. The Shins and the Arcade Fire, to pick two of the bigger success stories, had relatively short histories before raising their profile beyond college campuses, while more seasoned groups with major-label money-sacks like Built to Spill and Mercury Rev never cracked the  Billboard  top 50.  I could get all crotchety and bemoan this trend as the Johnny-Come-Latelies pulling the rug out from underneath the old vets, but it&amp;#39;s more likely just a matter of younger bands sounding more enthusiastic on their second or third record and working with a fresher formula.
 
 
Of course, Modest Mouse are the exception to this generalization, having scored in the hit-song jackpot 10 years and four full-length albums into their career.  Perennially relegated to the second tier of the 90s indie-rock league (I still remember mis-learning of them as a BtS spinoff), modern rock chart-topper &amp;quot;Float On&amp;quot; allowed Isaac Brock to have the last laugh on his former indie label brethren, as he enjoyed the kind of crossover hit that&amp;#39;s eluded so many major-label recruits since the heady days of grunge.  What was even more astounding was the fact that Modest Mouse-- mob cries of &amp;quot;sellout!&amp;quot; notwithstanding-- didn&amp;#39;t really compromise their sound for mass consumption: Brock&amp;#39;s weird yelp-shout retained its volatile quaver, the band&amp;#39;s punched-up rhythm section still sounded sharp and vital, and the hunt for cosmic guitar pedal settings still sounded like their driving passion.
 
 
The album that gave birth to &amp;quot;Float On&amp;quot;,  Good News for People Who Love Bad News , was similarly unmitigated down to its mouthful title, but indicated that Brock wasn&amp;#39;t treading water either, tweaking his sound to incorporate a touch of programming and the Tom Waits worship of his Ugly Casanova side project.   We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank  continues that measured consistency, preserving the core Modest Mouse sound despite the recruitment of historic guitar figure Johnny Marr while gently nudging toward new directions.  
 
 
Ironically, the most successful track on  We Were Dead  is the one that pushes hardest against the group&amp;#39;s established formula: the almost gaudy single &amp;quot;Dashboard&amp;quot;.  With Modest Mouse&amp;#39;s trademark itchy guitars all but drowned out by brass fanfares and slurring strings, &amp;quot;Dashboard&amp;quot; is the Vegas version of &amp;quot;Float On&amp;quot;, and it works as an experiment to see just how far they can push the dissonance of Brock&amp;#39;s multi-tracked barking against slick, commercially ambitious surroundings. 
 
 
Had the rest of the record gone further down this path of orchestration indulgence, it would&amp;#39;ve been either a classic or a disaster (just ask Trail of Dead, who&amp;#39;ve spent their time since  Source Tags and Codes  trying and utterly failing to create a similar kind of symphonic indie hard-rock). But instead of that dice-roll,  We Were Dead  continues to refine Brock&amp;#39;s aesthetic, producing another solid (if not necessarily great) record. The development is clear in the way &amp;quot;Parting of the Sensory&amp;quot; smoothly evolves from foul-mouthed acoustic lament to boxcar-hobo hoedown, or on tracks like &amp;quot;Fly Trapped in a Jar&amp;quot;, which takes an abrupt left turn halfway through from a dark, bristly screamer that echoes their earlier work to a jagged but dancey post-punk groove.  Those latter moments are likely where Marr&amp;#39;s much-anticipated influence is most obvious, but even then it&amp;#39;s subtle; rather than impossibly sounding like the Smiths all of a sudden, the band has fun pilfering the rhythmic sheets of mid-period Talking Heads on songs like &amp;quot;Education&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;Invisible&amp;quot;.
 
 
So yes, despite the hefty presence of Marr, it&amp;#39;s still undeniably Brock&amp;#39;s band, and his development as a frontman is most apparent in his impressive inventory of vocal characters: There&amp;#39;s ornery/shouty Brock, Waitsian-growl Brock, spoken-word proselytizer Brock, wounded/reflective Brock, and countless permutations of all of these.  Many of those personae appear in the same song or even the same line, singing backup to each other on opener &amp;quot;March Into the Sea&amp;quot; or allowing the singer to play call-and-response with himself on &amp;quot;Parting of the Sensory&amp;quot;. And when Brock can&amp;#39;t modulate his throat quite as sweetly as he&amp;#39;d like, he calls in the Shins&amp;#39; James Mercer, whose counterpoint on &amp;quot;Florida&amp;quot; and the excellent &amp;quot;We&amp;#39;ve Got Everything&amp;quot; help put a couple of strong follow-up singles in the can.  
 
 
Unless my radio barometer is totally out of whack, 2007 should be another banner year for the disorienting experience of hearing Modest Mouse sandwiched between Fergie and Fall Out Boy, not to mention    covered on &amp;quot;American Idol&amp;quot;   .  There&amp;#39;s no reason this development should be met with scorn; if anything, Modest Mouse should be championed for exposing a larger audience to a sound in line with classic indie rock, rather than aiming for more traditional rock sounds like many of their more accessible indie contemporaries.   That a window has briefly opened in the greater cultural consciousness to make room for Modest Mouse on the airwaves would have been unthinkable at the start of the decade; that they&amp;#39;ve remained so true to their core aesthetic in light of the temptation that success undoubtedly brings is rarer still.

    <title>11- Joanna Newsom: Ys: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/39644-ys
</link>
    <description>
         
The biggest tragedy concerning Joanna Newsom&amp;#39;s brave, marvelous new album,  Ys , would be if
everyone sat there listening to it like bored middle-school kids at an amateur
Shakespeare production. Newsom&amp;#39;s copious, knotty verse is far removed from that of the old poet, but its effect on the crowd is similar: Yes, it&amp;#39;s hard to follow without the lyric sheet,
it takes a few passes to catch the nuances, and all that drama can seem like something of a
history lesson.   Ys -- pronounced
&amp;quot;ees&amp;quot; or if you prefer, &amp;quot;yeesh&amp;quot;-- is free of the jolts and heads-up hooks
we expect from pop music.  But
while it&amp;#39;s sure to suffer accusations of empty self-indulgence from some,  many will find the contrary truer:  Ys  offers an endless wealth of substance, teeming with dense, well-mapped beauty. 
 
 
Take one example: &amp;quot;Monkey and Bear&amp;quot;. The song&amp;#39;s title characters escape from the farm
where they&amp;#39;ve lived safely all their lives, before one deviously cons the other into performing for frightened children in order to make a living. Listen to the greed the monkey conveys in degrading, insulting, and controlling the bear, and the tight grip he keeps on her dignity so as not
to lose her-- which, of course, by the end, he does. Not bad for what starts out like a nursery rhyme.
 
 
Newsom has said that all five of the songs on this 55-minute album tell true
stories.  But to find them, you&amp;#39;ll wade
through lines and lines of fantastic allegories and arcane references.  Early listeners have latched onto the
folky-druid overtones as an excuse to dismiss the record.  But nobody&amp;#39;s going to reject a record this bold just because
Newsom uses the word &amp;quot;thee&amp;quot; on occasion, or because she appears in promotional photos wearing a
wolf pelt ass-up on her head.  What we
really can&amp;#39;t handle is escapism. We instinctively balk at artists who hunker down in their own worlds-- especially
when they force us to guess what they&amp;#39;re thinking.  
 
 
For someone who&amp;#39;s been pegged as an &amp;quot;outsider
artist,&amp;quot; Newsom chose a presentation that&amp;#39;s defiantly decorous.  Van Dyke Parks&amp;#39; orchestration is polite, never intruding on her performance. 
And her voice, though less shrieky and childlike than on  The Milk-Eyed
Mender ,  is still a tough read.  The way she creaks, wavers, and punches the
lyrics is expressive but never in an obvious way; rather than just illuminating
the lyrics, she&amp;#39;s almost sticking another code on top of them.
 
 
But for all the exquisite melodies, arrangements, and production work, Newsom&amp;#39;s lyrics make the performance.  She crafts elaborate images but drives them
with strong actions, and even the densest tangents keep pulling you along.  An image like this one, from &amp;quot;Emily&amp;quot;--
 
 
 
&amp;quot;I dreamed you were skipping little stones across
the surface of the water 
frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever, 
in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky&amp;#39;d been breathing on a mirror&amp;quot; 
 
 
-- is beautiful in its own right, but it&amp;#39;s also full
of movement.  Every line of the record
conveys some want or desire.  This is
easy to hear on &amp;quot;Only Skin&amp;quot;, the most modern (and Kate Bush-like) cut,
where she describes &amp;quot;being a woman&amp;quot;-- feeling fear, carrying candy like a
mother, sharing her lover-- with language as vivid as she uses for a cloudy
sky.  Her eloquence starts to feel so
natural that when she sings a line as blunt as, &amp;quot;Stay with me for a
while/ That&amp;#39;s an awfully real gun&amp;quot;-- it sticks out like a rend in fabric.  And the centerpiece, &amp;quot;Sawdust and Diamonds&amp;quot;,
comes closest to a full release: While the strings take a smoke break, she
performs an exhilarating rhapsody where striking verbs-- &amp;quot;cleft,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;shook,&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;buckle,&amp;quot; &amp;quot;crash&amp;quot;-- support sweeping allusions to death, love, and fear.  Her heart&amp;#39;s racing, and she doesn&amp;#39;t
stop it.
 
 
This isn&amp;#39;t a great album because she owns a dog-eared
encyclopedia, or because it stands above the cheap rewards or superficial
freakiness we expected from her.  It&amp;#39;s
great because Newsom confronts a mountain of  conflicting feelings, and
sifts through them for every nuance.  It&amp;#39;s intricate and crammed with information, but it&amp;#39;s never
bookish, and she never sits back in a spell and lets her heart flutter: She
swoops into the sky and races across the ground, names every plant and every
desire, and never feels less than real. 
The people who hear this record will split into two crowds: The ones who
think it&amp;#39;s silly and precious, and the ones who, once they hear it, won&amp;#39;t be able to live without it.

    <title>12- Of Montreal: Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer?: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/40551-hissing-fauna-are-you-the-destroyer
</link>
    <description>
         
The breakup album is a familiar pop music trope-- countless artists have harnessed the emotional fallout of a relationship to fuel their songwriting efforts. The less imaginative practitioners wind up churning out acoustic self-pity or overdriven spite and angst, while the most effective have draped heartbreak in a clever disguise (like the high-gloss domestic dispute of Fleetwood Mac&amp;#39;s  Rumours ), or rendered personal pain as the most important event in human history (like the symphonic catharsis of ABC&amp;#39;s  The Lexicon of Love ).
 
 
Despite a soft spot for concept albums, Of Montreal would seem an unlikely participant in this arena, having spent much of their career eschewing confessional introspection for escapist fantasy.  Even amidst the notebook-doodle psychedelia society of Elephant 6, Kevin Barnes and his compatriots stood apart for their day-glo Nickelodeon world, full of bizarre characters with alliterative names and toy-box, sugar-high arrangements.  While there&amp;#39;s always been a dark streak running through Of Montreal&amp;#39;s cartoon universe-- and Barnes&amp;#39; chipmunk-shrill voice sometimes tips disturbingly from childlike to desperate-- few would look to the Athens, Geo., band to accurately depict love&amp;#39;s gory aftermath. 
 
Yet in the past year, storm clouds have intruded upon the band&amp;#39;s rainbow domain as Barnes went through a separation (he and his wife have since reconciled); concurrently, the band&amp;#39;s sound has been slowly molting off the giddy pop of its early days, using its past couple of albums to test the waters of a more sinister combination of synth-pop and glam without abandoning its steakhouse jingle-worthy melodies.  These two plot threads intertwine at  Hissing Fauna, Are You the Destroyer? , an astonishingly good late-period record from Of Montreal that&amp;#39;s as uncomfortably savage in its depiction of breakup psychology as it is relentlessly catchy.   
 
The emotional accuracy of the record lies in Of Montreal&amp;#39;s unwillingness, or perhaps inability, to settle for &amp;quot;woe is me&amp;quot; moping.  Barnes resists the urge to cry into an acoustic guitar, instead portraying the full-spectrum manic mood-swings of the brokenhearted: desperately seeking distraction in drugs or religion, imagining himself as a cynical-minded lothario, and even considering violence.  When Barnes does directly give in to his despair, it produces the monolithic 12-minute centerpiece of &amp;quot;The Past Is a Grotesque Animal&amp;quot;, a gutwrenching soundtrack provided by an unrelenting bassline and a synth solo that sounds like an angry flying saucer. 
 
The rest of  Hissing Fauna  is an endless supply of off-kilter but instantly appealing melodies intact over the band&amp;#39;s newly robotic sound.  The focus throughout is on mechanized rhythms and synthesizer swirls, though the tempos are no less hyperactive, and the attention span of the arrangements is only a shade longer.  Occasionally, the bright synthesizers appear to mock Barnes&amp;#39; shadowy feelings, like the roller-skate organ riff that flits about the pleading drug-use of &amp;quot;Heimdalsgate Like a Promethean Curse&amp;quot;, or the Christmas carol exterior of depression saga &amp;quot;A Sentence of Sorts in Kongsvinger&amp;quot;. 
 
Of Montreal&amp;#39;s full embrace of this new sound works best in the record&amp;#39;s second half, as after the soul-purge of &amp;quot;The Past Is a Grotesque Animal&amp;quot;, Barnes tries to slut away the pain through a series of sex jams no less memorable for being completely unconvincing.  &amp;quot;Bunny Ain&amp;#39;t No Kind of Rider&amp;quot; finds the singer sauntering through the club brushing off sexual advances from both women and men and boasting of &amp;quot;soul power,&amp;quot; while &amp;quot;Faberge Falls for Shuggie&amp;quot; struts over a bassline funkier than I ever could have imagined the group capable of producing.  Throughout, Barnes multi-tracks several lascivious voices, making bizarre double entendres out of parachutes and interiors. It&amp;#39;s not the direction many of their fans might&amp;#39;ve imagined they&amp;#39;d take, but it&amp;#39;s that very attribute that makes it so ceaselessly fascinating and inexhaustibly replayable.

    <title>13- Jos Gonzlez: Stay in the Shade EP: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18322-stay-in-the-shade-ep
</link>
    <description>
        When Jose Gonzalez's debut album,  Veneer , began to catch on in 2005-- two years after it was first issued-- part of its magic involved the long journey the
Swedish/Argentine singer-songwriter's recordings had made.
With so much time elapsed between those recordings, it's a little disappointing that the
follow-up, five-track EP  Stay in the Shade , sounds mostly like
more of the same. The tightly double-tracked
vocal fjords and sinuous finger-picking remain, as do Gonzalez's lyrics, which stick mostly to
Nick Drake's strangely suggestive universals: &quot;It's warm in the blood/
Cold in the rain,&quot; he coos on erstwhile B-side &quot;Down the Hillside&quot;, an
incongruously chipper (for Gonzo) ditty about cemeteries. Another
former flip, &quot;Sensing Owls&quot;, slows the pace for a tralatitious
take on mountaintops, coming-outs, and the lack of designated drivers. The biggest changes from
 Veneer  are an increased use of hand percussion and less frequent
bossa nova tinges, so hold onto your knitted hats. 

All along, Gonzalez has been the rare singer-songwriter known more for
a cover than for his, y'know, songwriting. The centerpiece of
 Veneer  was his aching rendition of the Knife's &quot;Heartbeats&quot;,
which has since earned him fame and fortune by appearing in a Sony
commercial and, subsequently, the UK top 10. His sequel of sorts, a cover of Kylie
Minogue's &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot;, deserves credit for its steadfast
straight-face, though by the end his earnestness, percussive
guitar-playing and the dopey lyrics have him seeming more like a
cuddly coffeehouse troubadour along the lines of Matt Wertz or Dave
Barnes than a haunted lo-fi auteur. Put in terms of
fellow coverman Mark Kozelek, of Red House Painters and Sun Kil Moon,
if &quot;Heartbeats&quot; was  What's Next to the Moon  then &quot;Hand on Your
Heart&quot; is closer to  Tiny Cities .  

Thing is, Gonzalez's records are more aesthetic than songs. Eerie,
stripped to the waist, and raining classical guitar; it's a fine style,
and perfect for bringing the dance-oriented songs of the Knife and
Kylie to audiences that otherwise might be loath to embrace them. But
weightless Joao Gilberto-like singing and delicately plucked Drakeisms will
only get Gonzalez so far until his compositions catch up. A closing,
untitled instrumental features remarkably humble, droning
guitar-playing and funereal horns. A crowd chatters for its final two
minutes, as if still waiting for something to begin.

    <title>14- Devendra Banhart: Nino Rojo: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/15296-nio-rojo
</link>
    <description>
        It's funny that Young God founder Michael Gira should make a point in the press release for  Nino Rojo 
that his role in Devendra Banhart's career was merely to release his music, that everything else took care
of itself.  I imagine Gira felt strongly about Banhart from the get-go, and his pleasant surprise that the
rest of the world (inasmuch as Banhart's newfound popularity translates to the &quot;rest&quot; of anything) has
since come to agree is equally understandable.  Yet, I wonder if, like me, Gira gets the feeling that
Banhart has arrived at a place where he's independent of Young God, himself, or his press.  Journalists
are often accused of hubris, wherein they're supposed to believe the things they write about are necessarily
benefited due to increased publicity.  In fact, musicians can benefit from this, but if I'm to believe Gira
(and I do), Banhart's success is due more to people responding &quot;honestly to his music.&quot; 

The last time I wrote about Banhart, regarding his  Rejoicing in the Hands  album from earlier this
year, I emphasized how removed from contemporary context his songs felt.  His music seemed to me neither
superficially &quot;odd&quot; nor caught up in what my fellow music writers call &quot;freak-folk&quot; (despite the fact that
Banhart's compilation  Golden Apples of the Sun  assisted greatly in defining the term).  His music
felt like the impressions of one person, stopped along the way to record things he saw or thought, and
that even when I had no idea what he was talking about, the conviction at the heart of the songs would
resound a long, deep chord.  Almost two seasons later, things feel different: Like it or not, Banhart no
longer sings for just one person (either himself, or whomever is hearing him) and, more than with any other
artist, I'll identify him with 2004.  How's that for context?  

Okay, so for the first fallacy in my revelation: None of the songs on  Nino Rojo  are any more or less
intrinsically bound to 2004 than those on  Rejoicing in the Hands .  They were recorded at the same
Lynn Bridges-coordinated sessions that produced the prior album, and in fact will be released as a single
double-vinyl set with  Rejoicing  soon.  I could take a very easy way out and assume that over time,
these records will blend into one experience, in all likelihood becoming the definitive collection of
Banhart's songs.  However, where I formerly praised the singer/songwriter for taking me back to a time
before MP3s and compulsive music consumption, I now believe that his preferences for surreal list-songs
and lazy sing-alongs are simply an excellent counterpoint to these modern extravagances.  And counterpoints
are reactionary; they never exist alone.  

The second fallacy is that by admitting that Banhart's music seems to have a different audience or status
within whatever group he's supposed to speak for, despite not actually &quot;changing,&quot; is that I assume he was
ever speaking for anyone-- even scarier, that his music should necessarily be judged by whichever way the
wind is blowing.  Personally speaking, that's a sickening thought, but one that I take for granted in most
mainstream music analysis.  Gira talks about honest responses to music, and mine is that Banhart's songs
are now as typically, idiosyncratically &quot;him&quot; as ever.  I have the faint impression of a returning traveler,
despite knowing these pieces aren't actually &quot;new.&quot;  However, it's not spring anymore, and few who hear this
record are going to be in the same frame of mind they were last April.  Perhaps that's a good argument for
originally releasing  Nino Rojo  with  Rejoicing  as a double-CD set.  It's no judgment against
Banhart, but my gut says this music will be received slightly less enthusiastically than his prior work.  

That said, the music, fittingly, inevitably speaks for itself.  The most interesting to me are the songs
that suggest Banhart could become some kind of mythical roots-rocker, as on &quot;We All Know&quot; and &quot;Be Kind&quot;.
There, I imagine a very informal meeting of the minds in Memphis, where the ghosts of Richard Manuel, Gram
Parsons and a drunk Joe Strummer bark out the choruses in Banhart's half-euphoric, half-tossed off songs.
But he's preoccupied with other things: &quot;The light of this whole world and mind aligns your legs to time.&quot;
I think that means he has a crush on CocoRosie's Bianca Casady, to whom &quot;Be Kind&quot; is dedicated.  He gets
even more to the point on &quot;A Ribbon&quot;, with his most straightforward request, &quot;I'd like to sleep with you
if you'd like me to.&quot;  

However, Banhart's disinterest in obvious narratives is, for now, his greatest strength.  Even when, as on
&quot;Ay Mama&quot;, his statements would be clear, he obscures them.  &quot;Ay Mama, no hay que llorar,&quot; repeated over
delicate, finger-picked acoustic guitar figures, serves as mantra-- all the better not knowing he's trying
to persuade his mother that it's not necessary to cry.  Would the song have more emotional weight if I
didn't have to google the translation?  Banhart, throughout  Nino Rojo , demonstrates that it wouldn't;
the whimsical non-sequiturs of &quot;We All Know&quot; (&quot;Like the type of tongue that roots from your breast/ And it
shakes your pretty little clavicle&quot;), the zoological parade of &quot;Little Yellow Spider&quot; (where Banhart pays
tribute to pigs mating with men, crabs turning to crab-cakes, and white monkeys who figured out something
he couldn't understand) and the poetic depictions of &quot;Owl Eyes&quot; (&quot;Semilla/ Owl Eyes unwinding/ Asia/ All
your little diamonds, all your little diamonds&quot;) reveal little beyond the impressions of dusty, old calm
and the American surreal.  

Banhart covers Ella Jenkins' &quot;Wake Up, Little Sparrow&quot; as the opener to this album.  The 80-year-old Jenkins
has a made a career of creating children's folk music with an educational and inclusively moral bent, and
perhaps lends  Nino Rojo  its best context: Over time, beyond cultural movement and sociological or
musicological phenomenon, Banhart's record makes the most sense at the mercy of simple pleasures and the
young at heart.  You want truth?  Beauty?  They're here, in basic forms.  Progress and relevance are very
different concerns, and ones I'm willing to leave to historians with a better advantage.  And as all Gira
had to do was release the stuff, at the moment, I'm content to listen in turn.

    <title>15- Jose Gonzalez: Veneer: Pitchfork Record Review</title>
    <link>http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/article/record_review/18321-veneer
</link>
    <description>
        It's taken two years for the debut album by singer/songwriter Jose
Gonzalez (Swedish, obv.) to reach these shores, and it's easy to see
what nudged it here. Gonzalez's sparse recordings showcase
hushed, double-tracked vocals, haunted imagery, and a clearly gifted
classical guitarist. His gripping acoustic cover of countryfolk the
Knife's electro-pop &quot;Heartbeats&quot; was even a minor hit in his homeland. An ethereal, sometimes-aloof troubadour, Gonzalez will sing
you to sleep and then dash off under cover of night, leaving only
cold-sweat nightmares and an unopened bottle of sweet vermouth. 

Yup, two years, and on  Veneer , Gonzalez suggests he'd kinda
like to stick around for a few more. Permanence is a pressing concern:
With bongos and a hint of bossa nova, &quot;Remain&quot; emphasizes
perseverance, while the scant lyrics of handclap-enhanced &quot;Lovestain&quot;
complain of the marks you can't just shout out of you heart, maaan.
The arrangements are full of Nick Drake-style
open tunings (&quot;Stay in the Shade&quot;, in particular, can't escape the
shadow of that introvert-folk patron saint) and only a forlorn trumpet
on closer &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; disrupting the
guit/vox/maybe-tasteful-percussion train to Starbucks-comp paydirt.  

As with like-minded songstress Emiliana Torrini, Gonzalez is at his
best when he forces a personality onto his faceless raw materials. The
distinctive finger-picking on &quot;Crosses&quot;, the best original song on the
disc, rises like the spires of a Gothic cathedral, giving form to
lyrics about a redemptive light in the darkness (any religious
inferences, meanwhile, are left entirely to the listener). By
comparison, sotto voce opener &quot;Slow Moves&quot; tries a little too hard to
sound like its quiet-is-the-new-loud forebears, with a meta-chorus too
wispy to hold tight 'til morning: &quot;My moves are slow/ But soon they'll
know&quot;.  

Gonzalez's aforementioned &quot;Heartbeats&quot; cover is nearly as
spine-tingling as the original, if not its frenetic Rex the Dog remix.
Echoing M. Ward's &quot;Let's Dance&quot;, Iron &amp; Wine's &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;,
and Frente!'s &quot;Bizarre Love Triangle&quot;, Gonzalez strips the electro-pop
down to an acoustic lullaby, laying bare a powerful melody and
deceptively evocative lyrics about love, regret and nostalgia.
Gonzalez has also covered Kylie Minogue's &quot;Hand on Your Heart&quot;, and
the gulf that remains between these must-hears and his self-composed
material is significant. Gonzalez knows a great song when he hears it,
and he plays a mean guitar, but in 2003 he was still more raw than the
overseas buzz suggested;  Veneer  is nice, but it may just
scratch the surface.

For all intents and purposes, the White Stripes appeared to be defunct in 2006, put on hiatus while Jack White gallivanted the globe with Midwestern pals the Raconteurs. The previous year&amp;#39;s  Get Behind Me Satan , commercial success that it was, sounded in retrospect like a man frustrated with his duo&amp;#39;s limited options, fiddling with more keyboards and pedals than previous Stripes LPs. Coupled with White&amp;#39;s perceptible glee at the Raconteurs&amp;#39; expanded sonic palette and shared frontman duties-- not to mention the more diverse wardrobe options-- some thought it unlikely he&amp;#39;d don the red and white again any time soon.
 
 
 
Icky Thump , then, is a bit of a resurrection: Reuniting with Meg gives Jack the opportunity to slip back into sister-lover character, get his weird clothes out of attic, and return to basement blues. After the straightforward radio-rock trappings of the Raconteurs,   Icky Thump  packs an unexpected freshness, even given its back-to-basics premise; had it come immediately after  Satan , it could have seemed like a cynical, regressive gift to the core fanbase, but following  Broken Boy Soldiers , it recaptures a sense of goofy fun and a caustic edge that the duo haven&amp;#39;t possessed since  White Blood Cells  launched them to the A-list.
 
 
Recorded over what qualifies as a marathon session for the Stripes (a whole  three weeks ),  Icky Thump  re-assembles most of the scrap-heap elements that characterized the White Stripes&amp;#39; pre-fame trilogy: grimy garage-blues, a left-field cover, bizarre spoken-word bits, and shameless Zeppelin and Dylan cues. The most obvious breaking development is White&amp;#39;s instrument sound-- its tones are so aggressively tweaked that it&amp;#39;s hard to tell whether he&amp;#39;s playing a guitar that sounds like a keyboard or a keyboard being played like a guitar (prediction for the next White Stripes album gimmick: keytar). 
 
 
The leadoff title track declares this territory nicely, alternating an overdriven, tortured organ with savage guitar jabs, and already proving a better integration of keys and frets than  Satan &amp;#39;s marimba experiments. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m Slowly Turning Into You&amp;quot; blends Wurlitzer verses with fuzz-guitar choruses almost seamlessly; &amp;quot;St. Andrew (The Battle Is in the Air)&amp;quot; finds White facing off against bagpipes (yes, bagpipes) with chainsaw seizures; and on &amp;quot;Conquest&amp;quot;, he trades shrieking Casio tones with a trumpeter.
 
 
Yet,  Icky Thump  also treats us to a band that once again seems comfortable with its broken-in sounds, from the reverb-thud hammer of &amp;quot;Little Cream Soda&amp;quot; and the British Invasion 12-bar of &amp;quot;300 MPH Torrential Outpour Blues&amp;quot; to the back-porch ditty of &amp;quot;Effect &amp;amp; Cause&amp;quot;. Perennially dismissed, Meg White once again puts the lie to the theory that John Bonham like totally  made  Led Zeppelin bro, squeezing the most from her limited repertoire and unsteady tempo when locking in with Jack on classic Stripes-stomp breakdowns like the one in &amp;quot;You Don&amp;#39;t Know What Love Is (You Just Do As You&amp;#39;re Told)&amp;quot;, where raw talent takes a backseat to chemistry.  The duo&amp;#39;s effortless dynamic on &amp;quot;Bone Broke&amp;quot; dismisses the garage-rock trend starting to tiresomely re-bubble yet again amongst the indie dregs, showing that world tours haven&amp;#39;t taken them too far away from sweaty suburban Detroit house-parties.
 
 
But unlike most other 10th-time-around blues-rock revivalists, the Stripes don&amp;#39;t settle for endlessly rewriting &amp;quot;96 Tears&amp;quot;, as the record&amp;#39;s two weirdest (and maybe best) cuts prove. &amp;quot;Conquest&amp;quot;, with its theatrical vocal and faux-mariachi fanfares, teases a promising revved-up early Scott Walker direction until you realize that it&amp;#39;s a meticulous recreation of the Patti Page original. &amp;quot;Rag &amp;amp; Bone&amp;quot; with its spoken-word verses, is practically a thesis statement for a band that loves to write songs about itself, casting Jack and Meg as junk collectors with a way-creepy relationship, prone to amphetamine rambles and big, chunky rock choruses.
 
 
If there&amp;#39;s a complaint to be registered about  Icky Thump , it&amp;#39;s that certain aspects of the Stripes&amp;#39; early character appear to have been annexed off: The sweet pop of &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re Pretty Good Lookin&amp;#39; (For a Girl)&amp;quot; would probably be Raconteurs property nowadays, and White&amp;#39;s country dalliances (i.e. &amp;quot;Hotel Yorba&amp;quot;) are totally absent. Revisiting old territory also carries with it the hazard of backward comparison, and the highest highs of  Icky  can&amp;#39;t quite reach the altitude of the band&amp;#39;s breakthrough singles, but some of that inadequacy is tempered by the group&amp;#39;s more robust sound--  De Stijl  now feels anorexic in a side-by-side taste-test. Whether it was remembering their own advice from &amp;quot;Little Room&amp;quot; or the freedom to write in another mode with the Raconteurs, White&amp;#39;s strategy worked its rejuvenating magic, allowing the Stripes to roll back the stone on  Icky Thump .
