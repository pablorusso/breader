/************************************************************************************
												AJAX THREADS

	This is a simple set of functions that enable real AJAX "threading." It uses a
	global array of requests to track the threads. I just keep incrementing the array
	index, but I do delete expired entries as they are satisfied.

	This LOOKS simpler than ajax_queue.js, but is actually more complex to implement.

	For some time, I was under the impression that real threads weren't possible.

	That's because I made some mistakes in my implementation, and assumed some things
	about JavaScript that weren't true. JavaScript LOOKS like C, but sure as heck don't
	BEHAVE like it (for Ss and Gs, try doing an alert() with a function pointer as the
	parameter. If you are a C programmer, you'll be ROTFL).

	In any case, the real reason I had this impression was because I wasn't handling
	the client side properly. I was implementing a system that allowed instances to be
	overwritten, and this terminated the transaction.

	This won't fix that. That's because this is below that level. Like I said, this
	LOOKS simple, but you need to implement a fairly robust handler system on top of
	it in order to keep from stomping all over yourself. If you want simpler and more
	reliable, then use ajax_queue.js. It will be a lot easier to keep track of.

	Consider this in the same way you consider ajax_queue.js. It is a "low-level driver."
	This is not a threading framework, but could easily be the basis for a more
	comprehensive solution.

	HOW THIS MESS WORKS:

	This uses a global array (g_callback_array), which contains all the executing
	threads. When the thread is complete, the array elements for that thread are
	scragged, but the index keeps going. Since this happens on only one page, this
	shouldn't be a problem.

	UPDATE: As of version 1.0.1, I now re-use old elements.

	You can provide two callbacks to the request: a "simple" callback, and a
	"complex" callback. The "simple" callback is called only at the end of the
	request, and has fewer parameters. The "complex" callback is invoked at each
	stage of the request, and has a couple more useful parameters.

	In order to ensure that the callback to the request is always valid, I actually
	construct each "core" callback out of whole cloth, and slap it into the array
	element for that thread. Once the request is complete, the function is deleted,
	along with all the rest of the stuff.

	The "core" callback is used as a "router," in the same manner as in
	ajax_queue.js. It consolidates the HTTPRequest response with the data we keep
	in the array, and invokes the callback supplied by the calling context. This
	can be used to help the calling context re-establish its context in a callback.

	Your callback functions need to look like this:

			function SimpleCallback(in_text, in_param, in_param2)

	Where "in_text" is the response from the HTTPRequest, "in_param" is the first
	parameter you supplied, and "in_param2" is the second parameter.

			function ComplexCallback(in_stage, in_text, in_param, in_param2, in_index)

	This function adds two more parameters: "in_stage" is the stage of the HTTPRequest,
	and "in_index" is the actual index into the g_callback_array array for this request.

	The complex callback is always called before the simple callback. If you want to
	use it for catching the complete stage, then look for in_stage == 4.

	Version: 1.0.4

	January 6th, 2007:		Duh. Boy did I make a silly mistake. I had the wrong comparison operator
									for my "SupportsAjax()" function wrapper. Since I had incorrectly applied
									the typeof operator previously, this was masked, but when I stripped it for
									the IE5 fix, the bug came to the surface.

	December 20th, 2006:		I don't need g_callback_index anymore, so I made it a local.

	December 19th, 2006:		I fixed a bug in which the callback index was being unneccessarily
									incremented.

	December 19th, 2006:		I fixed the SupportsAjax() test. It wasn't done properly.

	December 19th, 2006:		I now re-use old array elements, as opposed to continuously
									incrementing the pointer.
